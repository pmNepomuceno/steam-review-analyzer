"""Inference for the TF-IDF + logistic regression sentiment model.

The artifact is produced offline by `backend/scripts/train_sentiment.py`; nothing here
trains. It is loaded on first use and cached. Loading is lazy so the module (and the API)
works without a trained artifact: training needs reviews that only the running API
ingests, so on a fresh setup the API has to serve before a model exists.
